# PythonProject

I created this gaming using the `Pygame` Module.

Players can use the `left/right` key to control the position of the flyer. 
And bullets are fired using the `space` key.

The programming style needs to be improved toward the OOP style.

One trouble I have for this mini project was that when I tried to pack it to a one-file executeble using `pyinstaller`, the resulting `.exe` file failed to work. 
Still trying to figure that out.
